To plan sensitive (i.e., sufficiently powered and precise) RTs on student achievement, reliable estimates of design parameters that adequately mirror the (clustered) variance structure of the intervention's target outcome are critical.

These design parameters include:

-   **Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs)**\
    ρ values that quantify achievement differences between clusters

-   **Explained Variances**\
    *R*^2^ values that quantify the proportions of explained variance by covariates at the various levels

Generally, design parameters should match the peculiarities of the target research context as closely as possible (e.g., the target population of the intervention, the specific hierarchical data structure, and the achievement outcome under investigation). There are multiple resources of empirical values of ρ and *R*^2^. A review of existing international and German research on multilevel design parameters for student achievement can be found in @stallasch2021. A meta-analytic integration of both single- and multilevel *R*^2^ values is provided in @stallasch2023. A useful collection of respective estimates for the United States is the ['Online Intraclass Correlation Database'](http://stateva.ci.northwestern.edu/) created by Larry V. Hedges and colleagues and hosted by the Institute for Policy Research at the Northwestern University.

## Multilevel Design Parameters for the German School Context

In this workshop, we draw on our own compilation of ρ and *R*^2^ values (and corresponding standard errors) for the German school system published in @stallasch2021. Based on three longitudinal German large-scale assessments (NEPS, PISA-I+, and DESI) which provided achievement data across the entire school career (Grades 1 to 12), we generated design parameters that apply to:

-   Several student populations

-   Both two-level (students within schools) and three-level designs (students within classrooms within schools)

-   A broad array of domains

*R*^2^ values at each level are available for three covariate sets:

-   Pretest scores

-   Sociodemographic characteristics (comprising students' gender and migration background, as well as parents' educational attainment, and families' HISEI)

-   The combination thereof

The design parameters are provided via an interactive Excel file (Supplemental Online Material B) that comes with a detailed introduction on the application scopes of the various sets of estimates. This document can be downloaded from the [OSF](https://osf.io/2w8nt/) or the [Journal's website](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/suppl/10.1080/19345747.2020.1823539?scroll=top).

To facilitate the workflow in R (e.g., to avoid time-consuming and error-prone C&P of estimates), an .rda file that encloses the full compilation of design parameters (as a list of data frames) is shared in [this course's repository on github](https://github.com/sophiestallasch/2022-workshop-CRT) which is ready to be directly loaded:

```{r}
# load design parameters from github
load(url("https://github.com/sophiestallasch/2022-workshop-CRT/blob/main/data/multides1.rda?raw=true"))
```

If you run into problems, [click here](https://github.com/sophiestallasch/2022-workshop-CRT/blob/main/data/multides1.rda?raw=true) to download the data to your local machine and then load it into R.

```{r}
# inspect list
summary(multides1)
```

The list contains 16 data frames, that can be grouped into two broad classes:

-   **Point Estimates and Standard Errors**\
    Data frames B1, B3, B5, B7, B9, B11, B13, and B15 contain the full sets of (population-specific) empirical estimates of design parameters for each domain, subdomain, and grade, along with their standard errors.

-   **Normative Distributions**\
    Data frames B2, B4, B6, B8, B10, B12, B14, and B16 (all data frames ending with "\_ND") contain (population-specific) normative distributions (i.e., minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum) of those design parameters summarized across domains and/or grades. These distributions can serve as guesstimates to plan studies whose target domain and/or grade is not covered in @stallasch2021.

# Normative Distributions

Data frames that contain normative distributions (i.e., B2, B4, B6, B8, B10, B12, B14, and B16) are structured as follows.

:::

Note that three-level design parameters (students at L1 within classrooms at L2 within schools at L3) were estimated for grades 1 to 10 only. For grades 11 to 12, no L2 estimates are available as 11th and 12th graders did not attend intact classrooms, but rather the grouping of students varied depending on the subject taught. Therefore, two-level design parameters (students at L1 within schools at L3) were estimated instead. Two-level equivalents for grades 1 to 10 (i.e., ignoring classroom-level clustering) are also provided; you can access them in the data frames labeled with '-2l'.

::: callout-note
Keep in mind that the top level (which is always the school level) is consistently indicated as '\_l3' across all data frames; irrespective of whether L2 estimates were estimated (i.e., also for two-level designs).

Detailed information on the provided design parameters and underlying analysis models can be retrieved from @stallasch2021.

### Achievement Domains

The design parameters cover the following achievement domains.

Note that the (sub)domain character strings in the data frames are named exactly like shown here. For instance, if we want to filter design parameters for English text reconstruction from data frame B1, we could use the following code.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
# filter English text reconstruction from data frame B1
eng_ctest <- multides1[["B1_General"]] |>  
  filter(domain == "Verbal Skills in English (as Foreign Language)", 
         subdomain == "Text Reconstruction (C-Test)")
```

However, to avoid to type the full strings, better use pattern matching functions like from the `grep()` family instead that will do the job for you.

```{r}
# better:
eng_ctest <- multides1[["B1_General"]] |>  
  filter(grepl("Eng", domain), 
         grepl("C-Test", subdomain))
```

Let's have a look at the filtered design parameters.

```{r}
eng_ctest |> 
  # transpose for better readability
  t() |>  
  kable() |> 
  scroll_box(height = "350px")
```

As can be seen, there are three entries for English text reconstruction as the respective test was administered to students at two time points in the DESI study, namely at the beginning and at the end of grade 9. For the beginning of grade 9, no pretests were available, therefore the corresponding cells are set to `NA`. A third set of estimates is provided here that contains the meta-analytically pooled results across these two time points (as indicated by 'DESI (Pooled)'). Note that this integration strategy (applying a fixed effect model approach) was also adopted for other domains in grade 9 in case multiple design parameters were available (as obtained either from several studies \[as indicated by 'All (Pooled)'\] or from the two time points in DESI).

## Advanced Covariate Selection for Single- and Multilevel Designs

Well-chosen covariates can dramatically boost power and precision in both IRTs and CRTs. Recently, we generated an extensive compilation of single- and multilevel *R*^2^ (and ρ) values for student achievement [@stallasch2023]. Alongside three psychometric heuristics, we analyzed (a) covariate types of varying bandwidth-fidelity, (b) covariate combinations to quantify incremental validities , and (c) covariate time lags of 1–7 years to test potential validity degradation in the covariates. We meta-analyzed the estimates from six quasi-representative German samples, covering various outcome domains and the entire school career. We also used the estimates to simulate precision. We won't use these design parameters in the present workshop. However, feel free to check out our [preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/5ajmg) and the corresponding Online Supplemental Material for manifold illustrative scenarios of study planning.
